Required components: Pneumatics Control Module (PCM), Compressor, electronic pressure sensor, over-pressure release, air tanks, release valve, regulator  

PCM needs to be wired into the CAN bus and power plugged in through Power Distribution Panel (PDP)  
- multiple PCMs can be used if IDs are changed  
- 2 different options: CTRE's PCM (8 ports) and RevRobotics Pneumatic Hub (16 ports)  

Compressor needs to plugged into dedicated compressor port on PCM   
Pressure sensor needs to be plugged into dedicated pressure sensor port on PCM  

Solenoids: basically any solenoid will work (as long it as proper fittings installed)  
- can be plugged into wired into PCM ports    
- commonly used double solenoids, so 4 pneumatics per PCM or 8 per pneumatics hub
